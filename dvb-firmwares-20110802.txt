  6. AV7110

dvb-ttpci-01.fw-261a 	Firmware 01.261a
dvb-ttpci-01.fw-261b 	Firmware 01.261b
dvb-ttpci-01.fw-261c 	Firmware 01.261c
dvb-ttpci-01.fw-261d 	Firmware 01.261d
dvb-ttpci-01.fw-261f 	Firmware 01.261f
dvb-ttpci-01.fw-2622 	Firmware 01.2622

The files are named dvb-ttpci-VV.fw-vvvv

  VV : Version of firmware-to-host API. You can simply upgrade
       the firmware binary with a newer one of the same API
       version without changing anything else in the driver.
  vvvv: Firmware version. Increased with each functional change.

It is recommended that you use the newest firmware binary
compatible with your driver. If you use the hotplug firmware loader
in Linux 2.6 you must put the firmware file in
/lib/firmware/dvb-ttpci-01.fw (in previous versions of the Linux
hotplug scripts it was /usr/lib/hotplug/firmware/dvb-ttpci-01.fw).

Boot.S is the source for the boot loader which is included
as a binary blob in the bootcode array in av7110_hw.c in
the Linux driver source. For more information check the
driver tarball at http://www.metzlerbros.org/dvb/.

2009-03-19 v4l-cx231xx-avcore-01.fw
	Changes by Mauro Carvalho Chehab:
	- Added firmware file for cx231xx USB devices

2005-11-23 dvb-ttpci-01.fw-2622
	Changes by Werner Fink:
	 - AC3 output for live channels
	 - audio and PES filter error handling fixes
	 - tons of changes for better/faster A/V sync and PCR handling
	 - Initial implementation for ES/RAW audio support
	Changes by Oliver Endriss:
	  - support for extended RC5 (aka RC5+) infrared protocol
	  - fixed DPRAM timing to get rid of strange pseudo-handshake

2005-07-06 dvb-ttpci-01.fw-261f
	Changes by Werner Fink:
	  Restart error IRQ handler in case of an overflow as
	  described in the API manual.
	  Better auto detection of PES formats with AC3 and DTS frames not
	  starting with the payload of PES frames with PTS value.

	  Allow non aligned PES frames which include a substream ID for
	  PCM/AC3/DTS.

	  Use silent PCM for delay the PCM/AC3/DTS data to be able to
	  compensate the PTS offset of Audio and Video PES frames.  Mainly
	  done to be able to synchronize even within VDR transfer mode
	  where AV data are received just in time from the TV channel.

	  Calculate  the byte rate of Mpeg Audio date to be able to
	  synchronize without an hard offset.  This avoid jumps within
	  picture sequence due high PTS offsets at synching time. Also use
	  the sync API for Mpeg Audio at startup.

	  Add PTS reset after a PCM Bypass to be able to recover fast
	  enough and shorten the time used in the blank timer for
	  recovering.

	  Be sure that the Bits in the message status register are done
	  well.  Add two new bits which indicates play mode and stop spare
	  time.

	  Make ReleaseBmp work even during running Bitmap upload.  Be sure
	  that normal OSD command sequences will not destroxed by a normal
	  ReleaseBmp.  Be sure that the ACK to the PC work even if the
	  Bitmap upload is premature aborted.

	  Add a workaround to be sure that TX_BUFF is really reset by the
	  PC and does not provide the old value.  It seems that modifying
	  of IRQ_RX by the PC is not always in sync.
